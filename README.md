# Biquadratic Equations

A basic console app written in _C#_ that solves biquadratic equations. What's a biquadratic equation? It's a fourth-degree polynomial which is expressed as $Ax^4 + Bx^2 + C$ ($A, B, C$ are real numbers and $A$ cannot be equal to 0). The app doesn't calculate complex roots.

The comments in the project's code are in Russian, keep that in mind.
